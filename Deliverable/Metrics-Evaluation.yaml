metrics_for_evaluation:
  overview:
    description: >
      The evaluation metrics assess the performance and effectiveness of the FlexiMove Logistics Optimization AI Agent.
      These metrics ensure that the solution meets the defined objectives, aligns with supply chain goals, and provides
      actionable insights for continuous improvement.
    reference_models:
      - "DCM (Demand Chain Management) Model"
      - "SCOR-DS (Supply Chain Operations Reference - Digital Standard) Model"
  metrics:
    - name: "On-Time Delivery Rate"
      description: >
        Measures the percentage of deliveries completed within the scheduled time window. This metric evaluates
        the reliability and punctuality of the logistics operations.
      calculation:
        formula: "On-Time Deliveries / Total Deliveries * 100"
        example: >
          If 950 deliveries out of 1,000 were on time, the on-time delivery rate would be 95%.
      purpose: >
        Indicates how well the AI solution adheres to delivery schedules, which impacts customer satisfaction
        and supply chain performance.
      target_threshold: ">= 95%"
    - name: "Fuel Efficiency"
      description: >
        Tracks the fuel consumption improvements achieved by optimized routing. This metric directly correlates
        to cost savings and environmental sustainability.
      calculation:
        formula: "(Baseline Fuel Consumption - Optimized Fuel Consumption) / Baseline Fuel Consumption * 100"
        example: >
          If baseline fuel consumption was 1,000 liters and optimized routes used 800 liters, the fuel efficiency
          improvement would be 20%.
      purpose: >
        Demonstrates the cost-effectiveness and environmental benefits of the optimized routing algorithm.
      target_threshold: ">= 15% improvement"
    - name: "Response Time to Ad-Hoc Requests"
      description: >
        Evaluates the average time taken to integrate and adjust for new delivery requests into the existing logistics
        schedule. This reflects the agility of the solution.
      calculation:
        formula: "Sum of Response Times to Ad-Hoc Requests / Total Number of Requests"
        example: >
          If the system handled 50 ad-hoc requests with a cumulative response time of 500 minutes,
          the average response time would be 10 minutes.
      purpose: >
        Highlights the flexibility and adaptability of the system in responding to real-time changes.
      target_threshold: "<= 10 minutes"
    - name: "Customer Satisfaction Score"
      description: >
        Measures customer feedback on delivery experiences, including timeliness, accuracy, and service quality.
        This metric is subjective but critical for assessing overall service performance.
      calculation:
        formula: >
          Average Score from Customer Surveys (Scale: 1-5) or Weighted Average from Multiple Survey Questions.
        example: >
          If survey responses yield an average score of 4.7 out of 5, the customer satisfaction score is 94%.
      purpose: >
        Provides direct feedback from customers to identify strengths and areas for improvement.
      target_threshold: ">= 90%"
    - name: "Total Logistics Cost Reduction"
      description: >
        Calculates the reduction in total logistics costs (e.g., fuel, labor, maintenance) after implementing
        the AI solution.
      calculation:
        formula: "(Baseline Costs - Current Costs) / Baseline Costs * 100"
        example: >
          If baseline logistics costs were $50,000 and current costs are $40,000, the cost reduction is 20%.
      purpose: >
        Demonstrates the financial impact of the solution in terms of operational cost savings.
      target_threshold: ">= 15%"
  data_sources:
    - name: "Delivery Records"
      description: >
        Provides data on delivery times, locations, and completion status for calculating on-time delivery rate
        and response times.
    - name: "Fuel Consumption Logs"
      description: >
        Tracks fuel usage for each vehicle to measure fuel efficiency improvements.
    - name: "Customer Surveys"
      description: >
        Collects feedback from customers to calculate the satisfaction score.
    - name: "Financial Reports"
      description: >
        Contains baseline and current logistics costs for cost reduction analysis.
  continuous_evaluation:
    description: >
      Metrics are calculated periodically (e.g., weekly or monthly) to monitor ongoing performance
      and identify areas for improvement.
    process:
      - step: "Data Collection"
        description: >
          Extract relevant data from operational logs, customer feedback systems, and financial reports.
      - step: "Metric Calculation"
        description: >
          Use predefined formulas to calculate metrics for the specified time period.
      - step: "Performance Analysis"
        description: >
          Compare calculated metrics with target thresholds to identify successes and areas needing improvement.
      - step: "System Adjustment"
        description: >
          Adjust algorithms, parameters, or resource allocations based on metric analysis.
  explanation_for_agents:
    purpose: >
