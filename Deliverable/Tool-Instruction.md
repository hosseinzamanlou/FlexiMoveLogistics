# Tool Instruction: Comprehensive AI-Driven Logistics Optimization Tool

## Tool Description
The **FlexiMove Logistics Optimization AI Agent** is a scalable and modular solution designed for dynamic logistics challenges. This tool integrates advanced route optimization algorithms and visualization capabilities to provide actionable insights and efficient solutions. With an emphasis on sustainability and operational efficiency, it aims to minimize delivery costs and improve customer satisfaction.

## Tool Functionality Guideline with Examples

### Core Functionality 1: Route Optimization
- **Scenario**:  
  Optimize delivery routes across multiple vehicles while minimizing total distance traveled.
- **Parameters**:
  - `distance_matrix`: A 2D array representing distances between all locations.
  - `num_trucks`: The number of available trucks for delivery.
  - `coordinates`: The location coordinates for each address (including depot).
- **Algorithms**:
  - **Nearest Neighbor Heuristic**: Generates initial routes by visiting the nearest unvisited customer.
  - **Sweep Algorithm**: Groups customers into clusters based on their polar coordinates.
  - **2-Opt Refinement**: Optimizes routes further to reduce total travel distance.
- **Example**:
  - **Input**:
    ```json
    {
        "distance_matrix": [[0, 12, 15, 20], [12, 0, 10, 25], [15, 10, 0, 30], [20, 25, 30, 0]],
        "num_trucks": 2,
        "coordinates": [[0, 0], [3, 4], [6, 8], [5, 1]]
    }
    ```
  - **Output**:
    ```json
    {
        "optimized_routes": {
            "truck_1": ["Depot", "Customer_1", "Customer_3", "Depot"],
            "truck_2": ["Depot", "Customer_2", "Depot"]
        },
        "total_distance": 45
    }
    ```

### Core Functionality 2: Visualization
- **Scenario**:  
  Visualize delivery routes, including comparisons between one-vehicle and multi-vehicle scenarios.
- **Visualization Outputs**:
  - **All Addresses Visualization**: Displays all customer addresses and depot locations on a 2D plane.
  - **Single and Dual Vehicle Optimization Visualization**: Visualize the comparison between one-vehicle and two-vehicle scenarios for each route optimization algorithm.
- **Example Visualization**:
  - **Route Plot**: A graph displaying optimized delivery paths for vehicles, with annotated customer locations and depot.

### Key Features
- **Scalable and Modular Architecture**: Designed for scalability, allowing easy customization of route optimization algorithms.
- **Comprehensive YAML Configurations**: Facilitates seamless integration into AI platforms.
- **Visualization Tools**: Interactive visuals to highlight efficiency differences between scenarios.

### AI Agent Deployment Example
- **Input Requirements**:
  - YAML configuration file specifying parameters and interaction protocols.
  - Data files (e.g., distance matrices, location coordinates).
- **Output Deliverables**:
  - Optimized routes for delivery vehicles.
  - Visualizations comparing different optimization scenarios.

## Visualization Examples

### **All Addresses Visualization**
- Displays all customer addresses and depot locations with distinct colors on a 2D plane for easy identification.

### **Route Optimization Algorithm Visualizations**
- **Nearest Neighbor Heuristic**:
  - Displays one-vehicle and two-vehicle scenarios, showing routes generated by the nearest customer approach.
- **Sweep Algorithm**:
  - Shows clustered route optimizations.
  - Visualizes both single and multi-vehicle routes.
- **2-Opt Refinement**:
  - Compares refined routes for one and two vehicles to minimize travel distance.
