  interactions:
    - agent_to_agent:
        description: >
          The Demand Forecasting Agent shares predicted demand values with the Route Optimizer Agent,
          ensuring resource allocation aligns with upcoming needs.
    - agent_to_api:
        description: >
          The Real-Time Adjustment Agent interacts with external APIs, such as Google Maps and Weather APIs,
          to fetch live updates on traffic and weather conditions.
    - data_pipeline:
        description: >
          A centralized data pipeline ingests, preprocesses, and serves synthetic and real-world datasets
          to the agents for analysis and decision-making.
