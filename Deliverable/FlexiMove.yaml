# AI-Agent YAML Configuration for Route Optimization
AI_Agent:
  name: "FlexiMove Logistics Optimization Agent"
  purpose: >
    To optimize vehicle routing for logistics operations by minimizing travel distance,
    improving fuel efficiency, and ensuring on-time delivery. The agent dynamically adjusts
    routes based on real-time data like traffic, customer demands, and capacity constraints.

    - RouteOptimization:
        description: >
          Calculates the most efficient routes considering customer locations, vehicle capacities,
          and distance constraints using heuristic and clustering algorithms.
        methods:
          - Nearest Neighbor Heuristic
          - Sweep Algorithm with TSP Optimization
        data_sources:
          - DistanceMatrix
