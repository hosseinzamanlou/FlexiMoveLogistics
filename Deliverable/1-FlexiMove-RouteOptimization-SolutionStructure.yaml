  name: "FlexiMove Logistics Optimization AI Agent"
  purpose: >
    The FlexiMove Logistics Optimization AI Agent is a modular and scalable solution
    designed to improve logistics efficiency. It calculates optimized delivery routes.
    This solution aims to minimize costs, reduce delays,
    and enhance customer satisfaction in supply chain operations.
  functionalities:
    - route_optimization:
        description: >
          Calculates the most efficient delivery routes for trucks. Considers factors
          such as customer locations, traffic patterns, weather conditions, and time constraints.
        input_data:
          - "Distance Matrix: Precomputed distances between all locations."
          - "Customer Demands: Delivery requirements for each customer."
          - "Truck Capacities: Maximum load each truck can carry."
        output:
          - "Optimized routes for each truck."
          - "Estimated times of arrival (ETAs) for all stops."
    - real_time_adjustment:
        description: >
          Monitors real-time traffic and weather data to make dynamic route adjustments.
          Ensures that delivery schedules remain on time despite unexpected conditions.
        triggers:
          - "Traffic congestion detected on planned routes."
          - "Adverse weather conditions affecting delivery schedules."
          - "Ad-hoc delivery requests added during operations."
        interaction:
          - "Re-runs the route optimization algorithm when new data is received."
        output:
          - "Updated delivery routes and ETAs."
    - demand_forecasting:
        description: >
          Uses historical delivery data and seasonal trends to predict future demand.
          Helps optimize fleet allocation and staffing for upcoming delivery cycles.
        input_data:
          - "Historical order data."
          - "Seasonal demand patterns."
          - "Public holidays and other event schedules."
        output:
          - "Projected demand for the next delivery cycle."
          - "Resource allocation recommendations."
  interactions:
    - agent_to_agent:
        description: >
          Agents within the solution collaborate to ensure seamless operations. For example:
          - The Demand Forecasting Agent shares demand projections with the Route Optimizer Agent
            to ensure efficient resource allocation.
          - The Real-Time Adjustment Agent notifies the Route Optimizer Agent of significant
            traffic delays, triggering route recalculation.
    - agent_to_api:
        description: >
          External APIs provide real-time data for decision-making. Key interactions include:
          - Google Maps API for traffic data to detect congestion and estimate travel times.
          - Weather API for current and forecasted weather conditions affecting routes.
    - data_pipeline:
        description: >
          A centralized data pipeline ensures smooth data flow between agents and external
          data sources. It includes:
          - Ingestion of synthetic and real-world data for initial calculations.
          - Preprocessing and cleaning of input data for consistency and reliability.
          - Storage and access mechanisms to provide data to agents as needed.
  deployment_environment:
    platform: "Google Cloud Vertex AI"
    infrastructure:
      - "Google Maps API: Provides traffic data."
      - "Weather API: Supplies weather conditions."
      - "Python-based algorithms: Implements the core logic for route optimization and demand forecasting."
      - "Cloud storage: Hosts data for accessibility by agents."
  metrics:
    - on_time_delivery_rate:
        description: "Measures the percentage of deliveries completed within the scheduled time window."
        calculation: "On-Time Deliveries / Total Deliveries"
    - fuel_efficiency:
        description: "Tracks fuel consumption improvements due to optimized routing."
        calculation: "Baseline Fuel Consumption - Actual Fuel Consumption"
    - response_time_to_ad_hoc_requests:
        description: "Evaluates the average time taken to incorporate new delivery requests."
        calculation: "Sum of Ad-Hoc Request Response Times / Total Ad-Hoc Requests"
    - customer_satisfaction:
        description: "Based on feedback collected post-delivery."
        collection_method: "Customer surveys or ratings."
