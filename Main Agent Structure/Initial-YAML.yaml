# StructuredSolutionOverview:
  Name: "FlexiMove Route Optimization AI Agent"
  Purpose: >
    Enhance route efficiency and provide dynamic, real-time route optimization 
    for FlexiMove’s logistics, ensuring timely deliveries and reducing costs 
    by integrating with FlexiMove’s existing platform for both scheduled 
    and ad-hoc delivery demands.

  Functionalities:
    - RouteOptimization:
        Description: >
          Calculates the most efficient route considering customer locations, 
          traffic, weather, and delivery urgency, for both scheduled and ad-hoc deliveries.
        Algorithm: "Dijkstra’s and OR-Tools algorithms"
        DataSources:
          - historical_delivery_data
          - real_time_traffic_data
          - weather_conditions
        Output: "Optimal delivery route with ETA for each stop"
        
#Step 1: Understanding the Problem Scope and Data Preparation
In the logistics scenario of FlexiMove, there are several dynamic factors to consider:
Customer Locations: These are given as GPS coordinates and represent the stops on each route.
Traffic and Weather Conditions: Real-time data that impacts travel times and might cause route changes.
Delivery Urgency: A priority level that dictates whether a delivery is high-priority, medium, or low.
With these inputs, we need to calculate the optimal route that minimizes the travel time and ensures timely delivery. 
To start, we’ll use Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest path calculations within smaller segments or less complex routes, and OR-Tools for more complex or multi-stop routes.

#Step 2: Implementing Dijkstra’s Algorithm
Dijkstra’s algorithm is well-suited for finding the shortest path between two points on a graph, making it ideal for calculating direct routes or small delivery networks.

Python Code for Dijkstra’s Algorithm
Here, we assume a simplified weighted graph with nodes as customer locations and edges weighted by travel time (adjusted for traffic and weather).

python code

import heapq

# Define Dijkstra's Algorithm for Route Optimization
def dijkstra(graph, start_node):
    # Initialize distances with infinity and set the distance to start_node as 0
    distances = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph}
    distances[start_node] = 0
    priority_queue = [(0, start_node)]

    while priority_queue:
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)

        # Skip nodes if we found a shorter path
        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
            continue

        # Explore neighbors of the current node
        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
            distance = current_distance + weight

            # Only consider this path if it’s better
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (distance, neighbor))

    return distances

Explanation
Input: A weighted graph where nodes represent customer locations and edges represent travel times.
Output: Shortest path distances from the start node to all other nodes.
Functionality: This function helps calculate minimal travel times, considering real-time traffic as edge weights. Adjustments are made using data from real_time_traffic_data.csv and weather_conditions.


       
    - RealTimeAdjustment:
        Description: >
          Adjusts active routes dynamically based on real-time data like traffic 
          and weather conditions or new delivery requests.
        Triggers:
          - new_delivery_request
          - traffic_condition_change
          - weather_update
        DataSources:
          - live_traffic_api
          - weather_api
          - FlexiMove_delivery_data
        Output: "Updated route with recalculated ETAs"

#Step 3: Integrating Real-Time Traffic and Weather Data
To dynamically adjust weights in the graph, we pull data from real-time traffic APIs (like Google Maps API) and a weather API.

Example Code for Integrating Real-Time Data
python code

import requests

# Function to fetch real-time traffic data
def get_traffic_delay(location1, location2):
    # Sample API call to Google Maps Traffic API (replace with actual API details)
    # This is a simulated URL; please replace it with real API call and API key
    url = f"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json?origins={location1}&destinations={location2}&key=YOUR_API_KEY"
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()
    
    # Extract traffic delay in minutes
    delay = data['rows'][0]['elements'][0].get('duration_in_traffic', {}).get('value', 0) / 60
    return delay

# Function to adjust graph weights with real-time data
def adjust_weights_with_realtime_data(graph, weather_conditions):
    adjusted_graph = graph.copy()
    for node, edges in graph.items():
        for neighbor in edges:
            # Fetch traffic delay and adjust the weight accordingly
            traffic_delay = get_traffic_delay(node, neighbor)
            weather_delay = weather_conditions.get((node, neighbor), 0)
            adjusted_graph[node][neighbor] += traffic_delay + weather_delay
    return adjusted_graph
Code Explanation:

Traffic Delay: The function get_traffic_delay uses a simulated call to Google Maps API to fetch real-time traffic delays.
Weather Delay: For each edge in the graph, we add weather-induced delays from weather_conditions.

        
 

#Step 4: OR-Tools for Complex Multi-Stop Routes
Google OR-Tools provides a powerful Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) solver, which is useful for optimizing multi-stop delivery routes.

Python Code Using OR-Tools for Route Optimization
Here’s a sample setup using OR-Tools for FlexiMove’s multi-stop route optimization:

from ortools.constraint_solver import routing_enums_pb2
from ortools.constraint_solver import pywrapcp

def create_data_model():
    """Stores the data for the problem."""
    data = {}
    # Distance matrix - an example 2D array where entry [i][j] represents the distance from i to j
    data['distance_matrix'] = [
        [0, 12, 15, 21, 17],
        [12, 0, 13, 9, 7],
        [15, 13, 0, 16, 12],
        [21, 9, 16, 0, 10],
        [17, 7, 12, 10, 0],
    ]
    data['num_vehicles'] = 1
    data['depot'] = 0
    return data

def optimal_route_or_tools():
    """Solves the CVRP problem."""
    data = create_data_model()

    # Create the routing index manager
    manager = pywrapcp.RoutingIndexManager(len(data['distance_matrix']),
                                           data['num_vehicles'], data['depot'])

    # Create Routing Model
    routing = pywrapcp.RoutingModel(manager)

    def distance_callback(from_index, to_index):
        # Returns the distance between the two nodes.
        from_node = manager.IndexToNode(from_index)
        to_node = manager.IndexToNode(to_index)
        return data['distance_matrix'][from_node][to_node]

    transit_callback_index = routing.RegisterTransitCallback(distance_callback)

    # Define cost of each arc
    routing.SetArcCostEvaluatorOfAllVehicles(transit_callback_index)

    # Set the search parameters
    search_parameters = pywrapcp.DefaultRoutingSearchParameters()
    search_parameters.first_solution_strategy = (
        routing_enums_pb2.FirstSolutionStrategy.PATH_CHEAPEST_ARC)

    # Solve the problem
    solution = routing.SolveWithParameters(search_parameters)

    # Process and display solution
    if solution:
        route = []
        index = routing.Start(0)
        while not routing.IsEnd(index):
            route.append(manager.IndexToNode(index))
            index = solution.Value(routing.NextVar(index))
        route.append(manager.IndexToNode(index))
        return route
    else:
        return None
        
Explanation
Data Model: Contains the distance_matrix, a sample representation of travel distances between stops.
Manager and Routing Model: These set up the routing problem with OR-Tools.
Cost Function: distance_callback provides a custom cost (distance in this case) for each leg of the route.
Solution: OR-Tools finds the optimal route, minimizing travel time across multiple stops.
Step 5: Outputting the Optimal Route
The results from OR-Tools provide the sequence of stops, which can be mapped to GPS coordinates or addresses in FlexiMove’s interface.
