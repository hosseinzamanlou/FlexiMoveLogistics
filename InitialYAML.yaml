solution:
  name: "FlexiMove Route Optimization AI Agent"
  purpose: >
    To optimize daily routes for scheduled and ad-hoc deliveries across Switzerland and Europe,
    improving route efficiency, reducing operational costs, and enabling real-time adjustments 
    to meet non-contract demands. The solution integrates with FlexiMove's existing software 
    platform, responding dynamically to new delivery requests and external factors such as 
    traffic and weather.
  functionalities:
    - route_optimization:
        description: >
          Calculates the most efficient route for deliveries based on customer locations, 
          traffic, weather, and time constraints.
        algorithm: "Dijkstra’s, A*, and OR-Tools-based algorithms for pathfinding and optimization"
        data_sources: 
          - historical_delivery_data
          - real_time_traffic_data
          - weather_conditions
        output: "Optimal route plan with estimated time and distance per delivery sequence"
    - real_time_adjustment:
        description: >
          Adjusts the active route dynamically based on real-time updates for traffic,
          weather, and ad-hoc delivery requests.
        triggers:
          - new_delivery_request
          - traffic_condition_change
          - weather_update
        data_sources:
          - live_traffic_api
          - weather_api
          - internal_database (ad-hoc delivery data)
        output: "Updated route with recalculated ETAs for all stops"
    - demand_forecasting:
        description: >
          Uses historical data to forecast high-demand periods, enabling proactive fleet and 
          resource allocation.
        algorithm: "ARIMA model for time-series forecasting"
        data_sources:
          - historical_order_data
          - seasonal_demand_patterns
        output: "Predicted delivery demand for upcoming periods"
