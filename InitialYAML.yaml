StructuredSolutionOverview:
  Name: "FlexiMove Route Optimization AI Agent"
  Purpose: >
    Enhance route efficiency and provide dynamic, real-time route optimization 
    for FlexiMove’s logistics, ensuring timely deliveries and reducing costs 
    by integrating with FlexiMove’s existing platform for both scheduled 
    and ad-hoc delivery demands.

  Functionalities:
    - RouteOptimization:
        Description: >
          Calculates the most efficient route considering customer locations, 
          traffic, weather, and delivery urgency, for both scheduled and ad-hoc deliveries.
        Algorithm: "Dijkstra’s and OR-Tools algorithms"
        DataSources:
          - historical_delivery_data
          - real_time_traffic_data
          - weather_conditions
        Output: "Optimal delivery route with ETA for each stop"
        
Step 1: Understanding the Problem Scope and Data Preparation
In the logistics scenario of FlexiMove, there are several dynamic factors to consider:
Customer Locations: These are given as GPS coordinates and represent the stops on each route.
Traffic and Weather Conditions: Real-time data that impacts travel times and might cause route changes.
Delivery Urgency: A priority level that dictates whether a delivery is high-priority, medium, or low.
With these inputs, we need to calculate the optimal route that minimizes the travel time and ensures timely delivery. 
To start, we’ll use Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest path calculations within smaller segments or less complex routes, and OR-Tools for more complex or multi-stop routes.

Step 2: Implementing Dijkstra’s Algorithm
Dijkstra’s algorithm is well-suited for finding the shortest path between two points on a graph, making it ideal for calculating direct routes or small delivery networks.

Python Code for Dijkstra’s Algorithm
Here, we assume a simplified weighted graph with nodes as customer locations and edges weighted by travel time (adjusted for traffic and weather).

python code

import heapq

# Define Dijkstra's Algorithm for Route Optimization
def dijkstra(graph, start_node):
    # Initialize distances with infinity and set the distance to start_node as 0
    distances = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph}
    distances[start_node] = 0
    priority_queue = [(0, start_node)]

    while priority_queue:
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)

        # Skip nodes if we found a shorter path
        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
            continue

        # Explore neighbors of the current node
        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
            distance = current_distance + weight

            # Only consider this path if it’s better
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (distance, neighbor))

    return distances

Explanation
Input: A weighted graph where nodes represent customer locations and edges represent travel times.
Output: Shortest path distances from the start node to all other nodes.
Functionality: This function helps calculate minimal travel times, considering real-time traffic as edge weights. Adjustments are made using data from real_time_traffic_data.csv and weather_conditions.

       
    - RealTimeAdjustment:
        Description: >
          Adjusts active routes dynamically based on real-time data like traffic 
          and weather conditions or new delivery requests.
        Triggers:
          - new_delivery_request
          - traffic_condition_change
          - weather_update
        DataSources:
          - live_traffic_api
          - weather_api
          - FlexiMove_delivery_data
        Output: "Updated route with recalculated ETAs"

Step 3: Integrating Real-Time Traffic and Weather Data
To dynamically adjust weights in the graph, we pull data from real-time traffic APIs (like Google Maps API) and a weather API.

Example Code for Integrating Real-Time Data
python code

import requests

# Function to fetch real-time traffic data
def get_traffic_delay(location1, location2):
    # Sample API call to Google Maps Traffic API (replace with actual API details)
    # This is a simulated URL; please replace it with real API call and API key
    url = f"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json?origins={location1}&destinations={location2}&key=YOUR_API_KEY"
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()
    
    # Extract traffic delay in minutes
    delay = data['rows'][0]['elements'][0].get('duration_in_traffic', {}).get('value', 0) / 60
    return delay

# Function to adjust graph weights with real-time data
def adjust_weights_with_realtime_data(graph, weather_conditions):
    adjusted_graph = graph.copy()
    for node, edges in graph.items():
        for neighbor in edges:
            # Fetch traffic delay and adjust the weight accordingly
            traffic_delay = get_traffic_delay(node, neighbor)
            weather_delay = weather_conditions.get((node, neighbor), 0)
            adjusted_graph[node][neighbor] += traffic_delay + weather_delay
    return adjusted_graph
Code Explanation:

Traffic Delay: The function get_traffic_delay uses a simulated call to Google Maps API to fetch real-time traffic delays.
Weather Delay: For each edge in the graph, we add weather-induced delays from weather_conditions.

        
    - DemandForecasting:

          Predicts delivery demand patterns using historical data to help FlexiMove 
          prepare resources for high-demand periods.

        DataSources:
          - historical_order_data
