  Name: "FlexiMove Route Optimization AI Agent"
  Purpose: >
    Enhance route efficiency and provide dynamic, real-time route optimization 
    for FlexiMove’s logistics, ensuring timely deliveries and reducing costs 
    by integrating with FlexiMove’s existing platform for both scheduled 
    and ad-hoc delivery demands.

  Functionalities:
    - RouteOptimization:
        Description: >
