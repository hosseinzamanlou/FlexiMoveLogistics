Main Agent: FlexiMove Logistics Optimization Agent
Goal
The goal of the FlexiMove Logistics Optimization Agent is to optimize daily routes, predict delivery demand, and dynamically adjust operations based on real-time data (e.g., traffic, weather, and new orders). This agent’s functions include:

Route Optimization: Calculate optimal routes for deliveries.
Demand Forecasting: Predict high-demand periods to allocate resources efficiently.
Real-Time Adjustment: Modify routes in response to live data updates.
Agent Instructions
The Agent Instructions define how the agent operates with Vertex AI, what data to use, and how to perform each core task.

1. Route Optimization Instructions
Instructions:

Load Data:

Access historical delivery data and vehicle fleet data to calculate initial route assignments.
Integrate real-time traffic and weather data by setting up API endpoints.
Algorithm Execution:

For simple routes (direct paths), use Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path between customer locations.
For multi-stop or complex routes, use Google OR-Tools to optimize across multiple delivery points, considering vehicle capacity and delivery urgency.
Sub-Agent Collaboration:

Real-Time Adjustment Agent: Adjusts routes based on new real-time data (e.g., changes in traffic or weather) by re-running the OR-Tools algorithm.
Output:

Generate an optimal route plan with an estimated time of arrival (ETA) for each delivery stop.
Display ETAs and assigned routes to the FlexiMove interface.
Example Sub-Agent: RealTimeAdjustmentAgent

Goal: Re-evaluate and update delivery routes in real-time when live data (e.g., new orders, traffic changes) are received.
Instructions:
Monitor traffic and weather APIs for any updates and adjust route weights based on delays.
Prompt the main agent to re-run the OR-Tools optimization process if conditions change significantly.
Send updated ETAs and route changes to the FlexiMove platform.
2. Demand Forecasting Instructions
Goal: Predict delivery demand using historical patterns, allowing FlexiMove to proactively assign vehicles and drivers for high-demand days.

Instructions:

Load Data:

Access historical_order_data.csv and seasonal_demand_patterns.csv to train the demand forecasting model.
Include any holiday and seasonality data that could affect demand.
Run ARIMA/SARIMA Algorithm:

For basic trends, use an ARIMA model to forecast demand based on historical data.
For seasonally affected demand, run SARIMA with weekly or monthly periodicity to capture recurring patterns.
Sub-Agent Collaboration:

Route Optimizer Agent: Shares predicted demand values to help optimize vehicle allocation and delivery routes.
Real-Time Adjustment Agent: Adjusts forecasts in response to unexpected peaks in demand (e.g., same-day new orders).
Output:

Generate daily demand forecasts for the next 30 days, adjusting for seasonality.
Share forecasts with FlexiMove’s platform to allow for resource allocation based on expected demand.
Example Sub-Agent: SeasonalAdjustmentAgent

Goal: Refine demand forecasts by analyzing weekly and monthly seasonal trends.
Instructions:
Continuously review incoming demand data to detect unexpected deviations from seasonal patterns.
Recalibrate the SARIMA model periodically, and provide feedback to the Demand Forecasting Agent.
3. Real-Time Adjustment Instructions
Goal: Respond to real-time data updates, such as traffic conditions, weather changes, or new orders, to adjust delivery routes dynamically.

Instructions:

Monitor Real-Time Data:

Integrate Google Maps API for real-time traffic updates and a weather API to assess weather impacts.
Continuously check for new delivery orders to adjust schedules accordingly.
Update Route Optimization:

For route recalculations, adjust graph weights in the Dijkstra or OR-Tools algorithm based on updated delay times.
Use the RealTimeAdjustmentAgent to trigger a re-optimization of routes whenever significant delays are detected.
Output:

Immediately update FlexiMove’s platform with adjusted ETAs and route changes.
Display updated route information to drivers and ensure delivery priorities are met.
